 * that never takes focus never sees Escape. Focus moves to the panel as it
 * mounts and returns to whatever opened it when the panel goes away — otherwise
 * the next key press lands on nothing.
 *
 * **There is nothing to trap.** Core has no tab order at all, so Tab never
 * moves focus on its own and focus cannot leak out of an overlay by keyboard;
 * a modal's backdrop absorbs the only other thing that moves focus, a pointer
 * press. What is actually missing without help is the opposite: a keyboard user
 * has no way to *reach* the controls inside a panel. `focusable` and
 * `keyHandler` supply that, by cycling Tab over whatever the panel registered.
